  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the design analog of `cloud-itonami-
  isic-6512`'s `casualty.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- project intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds brief verification + IP/
                                 licensing-conflict screening writes,
                                 still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:project/intake` (no capital risk
                                 yet) may auto-commit. `:actuation/
                                 release-deliverable` NEVER auto-
                                 commits, at any phase.

  `:actuation/release-deliverable` is deliberately ABSENT from every
  phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural
  fact, not a rollout milestone still to come. Releasing a real final
  deliverable to a client is the ONE real-world design act this actor
  performs; it is always a human studio-operator call. `design.
  governor`'s `:actuation/release-deliverable` high-stakes gate
  enforces the same invariant independently -- two layers, not one,
  agree on this. `:risk/screen` is likewise never auto-eligible, at
  any phase -- the same posture every sibling's screening op has.
  Phase 3's `:auto` set here has only ONE member (`:project/intake`)
  -- this domain has no separate no-capital-risk 'file' lifecycle
  distinct from the project record itself.")
